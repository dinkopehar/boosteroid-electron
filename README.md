Electron wrapper for [boosteroid](boosteroid.com).

# Problem

On Fedora 40, I had a problem with their RPM package not being able to find the OpenSSL libraries. So I saw that GeForce NOW has wrapper in electron available on Flathub. So I decided to make a wrapper for boosteroid. Lot of code is copied from GeForce NOW's wrapper.
